# Horiseon-Home
## Description
This is the homepage for Horiseon Marketing.  The task was to refactor the code to make it more accessible and improve search engine optimization (SEO). Semantic elements were added to make the site easier for the browser to understand and improve accessibility.  A more specific title in the meta data was added so the name of the company displays in the tab.. The CSS was edited to align with the elements so the website will still look the way the client wishes; it was also condensed so there was less repeated code.  Notes were added to the HTML and CSS  for clarity.
